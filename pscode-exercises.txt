add the 2 number together

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

call 5 numbers

add the 5 numbers into array named "list1"

divide by number of positions in list1

print "the average is", list1 average

call  "list1"

sort where ascending is true

print "The smallest is" position 1 of list1

sort where descinding is true

print The biggest is" position 1 of list1
